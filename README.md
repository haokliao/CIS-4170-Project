# CIS-4170-Project

Due to time limitations, I wasn't able to add a package manager, but all the packages/libraries that we used were standard installation for our CIS 4170 Class.

These include:

- Pandas for data wrangling
- Geopandas for geo-data visualization
- Plotly Express, Holoviews for data visualization
- Panel for widget use and page templating for our dashboard

Running this code and dashboard is as easy as:

- Ensuring that **Housing_Maintenance_CV_cleaned** and **NTA map.geojson** are in the same folder as the python_project file.

- Opening the **python_project** jupyter notebook file and hitting the Run All command.

This file is formatted to open our dashboard on a localhost in your default internet browser.

Upon having this dashboard open up in your browser, navigation is as simple as clicking on a button on the sidebar for the visualization along with a widget to appear on the screen in front

Alternatively, the data wrangling code is available at data_cleaning.py, and it is left there for your consideration along with the clean, non-wrangled version of the Housing_Maintenance_Code_Violations file.
